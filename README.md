# IT Logger
Project from @bradtraversy. Web app designed to keep track of logs for an IT department. Users can update tasks, change status of tasks, change technicians, etc.

# Motivation
To practice what I learned from @bradtraversy 's React course on Udemy, including front end design, backend storage, Redux state management, and Heroku deployment.
