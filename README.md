# IT Logger
Project from [@bradtraversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy). Web app designed to keep track of logs for an IT department. Users can update tasks, change status of tasks, change technicians, etc.

# Motivation
To practice turning a front end app into a fullstack MERN app. To combine different skills I learned from [@bradtraversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s [React course.](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/)
